      <center><p>
        This On Monday we started working with Tinker CAD and designed a <br>
        Rube Goldberg machiene with percise measurements so we could <br>
        build one in the future. Then on friday we had our second challenge <br>
        of the week, being the challenge of making a household appliance in <br>
        Tinker CAD. For this challenge I made an eraser, however while I <br>
        did not win it was a fun experience and I got better at working <br> 
        in CAD.
